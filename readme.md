# Features

- Ability to add an artist endorsement for own bass
- Ability to plug your bass into an amp 

# Lessons learned
- The requirements for the app were designed around demonstrating the various relationships learned in course, so some features seemed shoe-horned in.
- class-based views have some limitations, so that mixing CBV and view functions added some confusion to how to accomplish a similar goal.


# Why Basses?
- I am an avid Bass player and have owned various bassses and amps over the years of playing in different bands.   While most of my more recent playing goes directly into the mixer board and in-ear monitors, I still recall the joy of plugging into a classic all tube SVT bass head sitting on to of an 8x10 speaker cabinet.
- extending this idea around basses, is the idea that combinations of basses, amps, and speakers can create unique sounds, but the appropriateness of it depends on the style of music that you want and the physical location since bass gear can be quite heavy and bulky.

# Icebox
  - create a library of community basses and amps pre stocked that any user can use
  - allow user to create rigs to save combinations of basses and amps with notes about why this is a good pairing
